          <p>For over three decades, we have been committed to the rehabilitation of sick and injured sea turtles. Our advanced hospital, founded by The Gordon & Patricia Gray Family, is one of the leading facilities in the state and a prime resource for sea turtle rehabilitation. It features a surgical suite, upgraded x-ray room, blood work lab, endoscope, and ultrasound – allowing numerous sea turtles to be examined and treated.</p>
          <p>Our treatment protocol is from rescue to release – which means that sea turtle patients are released as soon as they are medically cleared. If a patient is deemed non-releasable, it will be transferred to a different facility. All of the sea turtle patients on campus are actively receiving treatment with the ultimate goal to allow each rehabilitated sea turtle back into the ocean as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p>Advanced medical equipment is critical to saving sea turtle lives. Our hospital is now home to two additional world class machines, which transform patient outcomes and allow our ocean-side campus to serve as a global teaching hub. Our high-definition ultrasound machine enables hospital staff to clearly examine the intricate anatomy of sea turtle patients. This provides staff with a different perspective on ailments, allowing them to formulate targeted treatment plans.</p>
          <p>The second device, the Karl Storz EndoSkope, is the most advanced of its kind. Many of our sea turtle patients have complex internal medical challenges; such as plastic and fishing hook ingestion. The endoscope’s high-definition digital monitor allows our veterinarian to better examine delicate organs. Should patients need an endoscopic procedure, the team at LMC now has one of the most advanced tools available.</p>
